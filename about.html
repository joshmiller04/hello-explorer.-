    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite, has fascinated astronomers and dreamers alike for millennia. Its pale, silvery glow lights up the night sky, a sight that has inspired countless myths, scientific theories, and even entire fields of study. The Moon is about 1/6th the size of Earth and is positioned at an average distance of approximately 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) from our planet. Despite its beauty, the Moon is a barren, airless world, with surface temperatures that swing drastically from -173°C at night to 127°C during the day. It has no atmosphere to diffuse the harsh radiation of space, and its surface is continuously bombarded by meteoroids, leaving behind deep craters and pockmarks.

      Yet, this silent, desolate body plays an essential role in the mechanics of our planet. The gravitational pull of the Moon causes Earth’s tides, a rhythmic movement of water that has shaped the development of coastal ecosystems for billions of years. In addition, the Moon’s gravitational influence stabilizes Earth’s axial tilt, preventing extreme shifts in climate and helping to maintain a relatively mild climate over geological timescales. This delicate balancing act is thought to have been one of the key conditions that allowed life to flourish on Earth.
      
      The Moon’s surface is a geological record of our solar system's violent history. It features ancient volcanic plains known as maria, which were formed by massive lava flows billions of years ago. The numerous craters, such as the famous Tycho crater, are remnants of cosmic collisions that shaped the Moon over eons. Scientists believe the Moon was once part of Earth, created from debris ejected into space after a Mars-sized object collided with the young Earth around 4.5 billion years ago.
