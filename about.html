    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, has fascinated humanity for millennia and has played a critical role in navigation throughout history and into modern space exploration. Located about 384,400 km (238,855 miles) from Earth, the Moons gravitational pull affects not only the tides but also stabilizes Earth's axial tilt, contributing to the planet's relatively stable climate. Its surface, marked by craters, maria (flat volcanic plains), and highlands, is a geological record of billions of years of cosmic history. The Moon is tidally locked with Earth, meaning one side always faces our planet. This unique characteristic, combined with the predictable cycle of its phases, made the Moon an essential tool for early human navigation.

      Historically, ancient sailors and navigators used the Moons position and phases to guide their journeys. Lunar cycles helped early cultures track time, plan agricultural activities, and navigate the oceans. The synodic month, the time it takes for the Moon to complete a cycle of phases, lasts about 29.5 days, and many early societies used this cycle as the basis for their calendars. In addition to its phases, the Moon's position relative to other celestial bodies was critical for determining direction at sea. Sailors measured the angle between the Moon and stars to calculate their longitude, a method known as lunar distance navigation. The tides, influenced by the Moon's gravity, also helped seafarers estimate their position along coastlines, a technique that contributed to safe passage and exploration.</p>
