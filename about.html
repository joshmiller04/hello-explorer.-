    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, has captivated human imagination for centuries. Its pale, silvery glow lights up the night sky, creating a mesmerizing presence. Though barren and airless, the Moon has a profound influence on Earth, from controlling the tides to stabilizing our planet's tilt. Its rugged surface, marked by craters and ancient volcanic plains, tells a story of billions of years of cosmic history. As humanity continues to explore space, the Moon remains a symbol of adventure, mystery, and our endless curiosity about the universe.</p>
