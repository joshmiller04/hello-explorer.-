    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth is a dynamic and diverse planet, uniquely situated to support life in the vast expanse of the universe. It is the third planet from the Sun, orbiting in the "habitable zone," where conditions are just right for liquid water to exist â€” a crucial factor for life as we know it. Earth is the only known planet to harbor life, and its exceptional ability to sustain an incredible array of species, from microscopic organisms to humans, makes it a biological marvel. This life-sustaining environment is a product of complex interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere, and hydrosphere. The Earth's atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), protects life by absorbing harmful solar radiation and moderating the planet's temperature.

      The planets surface is characterized by vast oceans, which cover over 70% of the surface area, providing the foundation for most of the planet's ecosystems. The oceans act as a massive heat sink, absorbing solar energy and regulating Earth's climate. Above the oceans rise towering mountains, some of which, like the Himalayas, continue to grow even today due to tectonic activity. Earths surface is constantly reshaped by geological forces, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and the shifting of tectonic plates, which have formed the continents and driven the evolution of life.
